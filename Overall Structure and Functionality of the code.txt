1. The code begins by importing the `os` module, which provides a way to interact with the operating system.

2. Two variables `filename` and `filename2` are initialized with the values `'file1'` and `'file2'`, respectively. These variables represent the names of the files used to store the complaints and forwarded queries.

3. The code defines three functions:
   - The `read` function takes a `filename` as an argument and opens the file in read mode. It then prints a heading for the complaints register and reads and prints the contents of the file. Finally, it closes the file.
   - The `append` function takes `data2`, `stu`, and `roll` as arguments. It opens the file in append mode, writes the complaint details to the file, and closes it. It also prints a success message.
   - The `solve` function takes `role` as an argument. It prompts the user to enter a roll number of a complaint they want to resolve and a remark or solution for the query. Depending on the role (2 for CR or 3 for principal), it adds a specific string indicating who resolved the complaint. It finds the line number of the complaint using the `find_query` function, modifies the line in the file with the resolution information, and breaks out of the loop.

4. The `find_query` function takes `find_roll` and `filename` as arguments. It reads the file line by line and checks if a line contains the specified roll number. If a match is found, it returns the line number. Otherwise, it returns `None`.

5. The `forward_query` function takes `forward_roll` and `remark` as arguments. It first checks if the file specified by `filename` exists. If it does, it reads its contents and stores them in `data_search`. It then iterates over the lines, identifies the lines to be forwarded (based on the `forward_roll`), and adds a remark by CR. Finally, it opens `filename2` in append mode, writes the relevant lines to it, and closes the file.

6. The code enters an infinite loop using `while True:`.

7. Inside the loop, it checks if the file specified by `filename` exists. If it does, it proceeds with the following operations:

8. It prompts the user to select a user type (1 for student, 2 for CR, 3 for principal).

9. If the user type is 1 (student), it prompts the user to enter their name, ID number, and complaint. It then calls the `append` function to add the complaint to the file.

10. If the user type is 2 (CR), it calls the `read` function to display the complaints registered so far. It then prompts the CR to choose between solving a complaint, forwarding a complaint, or exiting. Depending on the chosen option, it calls the `solve` or `forward_query` function accordingly.

11. If the user type is 3 (principal), it prompts the principal to choose between checking all queries or checking forwarded queries. Based on the selected option, it calls the `read` function to display the corresponding file's contents. If the principal wants to solve a query, it calls the `solve` function with the user type set to 3. If the principal wants to resolve a forwarded query, it uses similar logic as the `solve` function, but it modifies the `filename2` file instead.

12. After executing the respective actions based on the user type, the code prompts the user to either end or restart the program.
